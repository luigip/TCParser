Problem Statement
    
You are placed in a maze represented by a rectangular board. Each cell of the board can be one of the following:
empty: is always passable (represented by a '.')
a wall: is never passable (a '#')
a key: is always passable; when you enter it for the first time, you pick up the key (a lowercase letter 'a'-'f')
a door: is passable only if you have a corresponding key (an uppercase letter 'A'-'F')
your starting position: an empty cell where you are placed at the beginning (a '0' digit)
exit point: an empty cell you must enter to get out of the maze (a '1' digit).
You must get out of the maze using a minimal number of moves. In one move you can get to a cell which is adjacent to your current position vertically or horizontally. You will be given a String[] maze. Each character in maze will represent a single cell of the maze. A key denoted with a certain lowercase letter opens the door denoted with the corresponding uppercase letter only. Return the minimal number of moves that will bring you to an exit point. There can be several exit points, in which case you can get to any of them. If you can't get to any exit point, return -1.
