Problem Statement
    
A DNA molecule is formed by two nucleotide chains of equal length. Each nucleotide in the first chain must form a bond with the nucleotide at the same position in the second chain. There are four types of nucleotides: A, C, G and T. Each type of nucleotide can only form a bond with one other type: A can only bond with T, and G can only bond with C. These pairs, AT and CG, are called complementary pairs. No other bonds are allowed. You are given a String nucleotides, where each character is an available nucleotide. Return the length of the longest DNA molecule that can be created using only the available nucleotides. The length of a DNA molecule is the number of nucleotides in either one of its chains. If no DNA molecule can be created, return 0.

Notes
-
For the purposes of this problem we assume that there is no restriction for the set of nucleotides in each DNA chain.
Constraints
-
nucleotides will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each character in nucleotides will be 'A','C','G' or 'T'.
Examples
0)

    
"AGGCA"
Returns: 1
The set of nucleotides contains only one complementary pair CG.

Returns: 3
The set of nucleotides contains one CG pair and two AT pairs.
2)

    
"ACCACCAACCA"
Returns: 0
The set of nucleotides contains only A and C nucleotides, which aren't complementary.
3)

    
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCGGGGGGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT"
